Section 1
If you unzip the package, there should be a folder called "CS4432_Project2_JasonDykstra". Inside is the project 2 dataset, multiple .class files, and a src folder. In a command line, if you navigate to the project 2 folder and type "java Main" the program should run. Make sure you are in the same directory as the .class files. Make sure the project 2 dataset folder is also in this directory. Navigation to a folder on linux can be done via the "cd" command and listing files can be done via the "ls" command. On windows these equivalents are "cd" and "dir" respectively. 

Section 2
All of my code works, last time I checked :) I used the given select and create statements to test some variations of range and equality searches.

Section 3
I do not do anything that invalidates the directions, however I did implement the string iteratable/iterator in some classes so that I could use for-each loops in my code. This made things flow nicer and look more compact, however I needed to overwrite some functions for this to work.
